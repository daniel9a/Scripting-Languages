A data frame is a special case of a list, with the object consisting of
a list of vectors, which are the columns of the data frame.  So, its
length is the number of columns.  On the other hand, a matrix is a
special case of a vector, with the matrix columns stored in column-major
order.  Hence its length is the product of the number of rows and the
number of columns.
